    text = """This dataset focuses on understanding how job order workers at a state university 
    perceive and are aware of inflation. It includes information on various factors 
    that might influence their perception and awareness.
    \nFeatures:
    Age, Sex, Socio-ec-onomic status, Civil Status and Educational Attainment
    \nAwareness of Inflation (measured using a Likert Scale questionnaire) - 
    Scores range from "Strongly Disagree" (low awareness) to "Strongly Agree" (high awareness)
    \nPerception of Inflation (measured using a Likert Scale questionnaire) - 
    Scores range from "Strongly Disagree" (low awareness) to "Strongly Agree" (high awareness)
    \nAnalysis:
    The study employs statistical tests to investigate potential differences in awareness and 
    perception across the various groups defined by the demographic features.
    \nT-test: This test would likely be used to compare awareness and perception scores 
    between two groups, such as males vs. females or single vs. married workers.
    \nANOVA (Analysis of Variance): This test would be used to compare awareness and 
    perception scores across three or more groups, such as the different socio-economic status
    categories or educational attainment levels."""
