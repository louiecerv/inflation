    Unlike Pearson's correlation coefficient, which assumes a linear relationship, 
    Spearman's rank only cares about the order or rank of the data points.
    Monotonic Relationship: It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be 
    described by a trend that consistently increases or decreases (either always going 
    up or always going down).
    Strength: The coefficient produces a value between 1 and -1. A value of 1 indicates a 
    perfect positive monotonic relationship (as one variable increases, the other always increases). 
    A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative monotonic relationship (as one variable increases, 
    the other always decreases). A value of 0 means no monotonic relationship.
    \nDirection: The positive or negative value reflects the direction of the monotonic trend."""
